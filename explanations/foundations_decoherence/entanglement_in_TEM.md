# Entanglement and decoherence in TEM
*Time-scale*  $10^{-8}$ s (in view of UTEM)

#### Statements
- It is generally accepted that the core loss interactions stemming from different target atoms in a special specimen are incoherent to each other.
- The strength or degree of entanglement is mirrored in the "mixedness" of the reduced density matrix, which, in turn, determimnes the degree of coherence and the entropy of the system.
